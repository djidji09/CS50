Times:

10 simulations: 0m0.028s
100 simulations: 0m0.027s
1000 simulations: 0m0.034s
10000 simulations: 0m0.109s
100000 simulations: 0m0.796s
1000000 simulations: 0m7.364s

Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: the 100 times is wrong i think

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: the 100000 times seems good enough
